#### Description:
Calculator Vault is a Flask-based web application that combines two distinct ideas: a password manager and an interactive puzzle challenge. The goal was to create a project that not only fulfills the basic requirements of secure credential storage but also introduces an engaging, user-interactive component powered by JavaScript. Rather than granting instant access to the vault upon login, users must complete a small, logic-based task: reaching a given target number using a calculator built directly into the interface. This adds a layer of gamification to the otherwise straightforward process of retrieving stored credentials.

When users visit the site, they can either register for a new account or log in with existing credentials. The registration process securely stores passwords by hashing them before writing them to the SQLite database, using the password hashing functions from the Werkzeug library. This ensures that no plain-text passwords are stored, even in a local database environment. Once registered, the user is automatically logged in and taken to the challenge page. Returning users log in and are similarly brought to this page, where a randomly generated target number is displayed prominently above the calculator interface.

The calculator is implemented using a combination of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for logic and interactivity. While a calculator might seem like a simple feature, much of the project’s complexity lies here. The JavaScript code needs to handle multiple scenarios: appending digits to the current expression, managing operator precedence, preventing invalid inputs like two operators in a row, clearing the display, backspacing individual characters, and computing results when the equals button is pressed. Every button press triggers event listeners in JavaScript that update the on-screen display in real time. The calculator’s functionality is completely client-side, but it also interacts indirectly with server-side logic by allowing access to the vault only when the displayed number matches the target number generated by Flask.

A particularly challenging part of the JavaScript implementation was ensuring the calculator behaved like a real device rather than simply evaluating whatever text was in the display. This required writing logic to determine whether the last pressed key was an operator or a number, blocking certain sequences of input, and ensuring the calculator reset properly after a calculation. The JavaScript also needed to avoid unsafe operations, such as division by zero, and gracefully handle user mistakes by preventing the UI from breaking.

Once the user successfully reaches the target number, the backend updates the session state to mark the vault as unlocked. At this point, the interface changes to display the vault — a password manager that lists saved credentials for different websites. Each stored entry contains a site name, username, and password. The vault interface allows the user to add new entries, which are then securely stored in the database linked to that user’s account. The separation of user data is achieved by storing the user’s unique ID alongside each password entry in the database, ensuring that even if two users save credentials for the same site, they will be stored as completely independent records.

The user interface is designed to be responsive so it works on both desktop and mobile devices. CSS handles layout adjustments based on screen size, ensuring that the calculator buttons remain usable on smaller screens and that vault entries remain easy to read. The combination of Jinja2 templates and Flask routes means that the HTML pages are rendered dynamically, showing only the logged-in user’s data and adjusting the layout depending on whether the vault is locked or unlocked.

The decision to make JavaScript the most complex part of the project came from wanting a truly interactive experience that feels natural to the user. While a calculator is a familiar tool, making one from scratch in JavaScript that behaves correctly in all scenarios — especially when integrated into a larger application — is nontrivial. This includes handling edge cases like consecutive operations, decimal input, clearing mid-expression, and restricting certain actions until the user resets the calculator. Furthermore, the calculator needed to maintain a smooth and intuitive user experience without unnecessary page reloads, which meant keeping all of its logic client-side and relying on real-time DOM updates.

From a security perspective, the vault and authentication system are separated from the JavaScript functionality so that no sensitive operations happen on the client side. The calculator is purely an access mechanism; the actual verification that the correct target number was reached happens on the server after the client signals completion. This prevents any attempt to bypass the challenge by simply manipulating JavaScript variables in the browser console.

In summary, Calculator Vault is not just a password manager but a hybrid of secure storage and interactive challenge. Its uniqueness lies in the integration of a custom JavaScript-based calculator that functions as an access control mechanism. The JavaScript is carefully programmed to handle all calculator operations, prevent invalid input sequences, and provide immediate, intuitive feedback to the user. Once the challenge is completed, the secure Flask backend serves the vault contents, maintaining separation of user data and ensuring that all stored credentials remain protected. This combination of technologies and the emphasis on JavaScript complexity make Calculator Vault both an engaging and technically interesting project.
